You can create a docker container based in the Dockefile of this folder.
In this case will pull the Python image.
When build the container like:

```bash
docker build -t st_docker .
```

will create the container that set a python environment that install modules in 'requeriments.txt',
will work in the /app directory,
expose a port,
and run the 'app.py' python script using streamlit run command.

One time your container is built, you can run it using:

```bash
docker run -p 8501:8501 st_docker
```

This must show you a Network url to use your streamlit app in your browser.

Note: you must rebuild the image each time you modify your python code.

You can purge previus versions of the same image or cantainers such as:

```bash
docker ps -a
docker stop <container_id> 
docker rm <container_id>
docker rm -f <image_id>
```
